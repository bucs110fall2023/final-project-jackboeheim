## Project Description

My project is a 3D raycasting algorith similar to the algorithm used in early 3D games like Wolfenstein 3D and the original DOOM game.

## Program Design

### Features

1. This program allows the user to walk forward and backward and look left and right
2. The program saves the user's data automatically every frame, so whenever the program is launched, the player is in the same position and facing the same direction
3. The program features collision detection, disallowing the user from walking into walls
4. Wall colors can easily be modified in the code and currently 3 different color walls are present
5. Walls are shaded depending upon what face of the wall is being looked at
